# About BITbuilder
**BITbuilder** is a MySQL querybuilder created by software developer interns at [**Brainstorm IT**](https://www.brainstormit.nl/) and uses the PHP Data Objects extension (PDO) for accessing databases. 
This querybuilder is designed to be as simple as possible with almost no learning curve attached. 
[**Laravels**](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/queries) querybuilder has been an inspiration to how we wanted the BITbuilder syntax to look like, so syntax wise a few comparisons can be made.
